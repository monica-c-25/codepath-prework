## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
- Youtube: play video in background, captions
- Facetime: spotify shareplay, live picture screenshots
- Facebook Messenger: muting chat, setting chat emoji

An app I would like to build would be a running app similar to MapMyRun but with additional features. This app will be for the Bay Area and will map  a circular route be based on the distance the user wants to run. The user can add landmarks or rest stops that they would like to pass. The app will also give the user information regarding elevation, humidity, temperature, pace, and all the other essential running features. There will also be the option for user input on route closures, animal sightings, general safety, and terrain. The app can be built like a social network as well, allowing users to share their runs with friends and family. 

## Notes

I initially had some trouble getting the button to work and change the background color. It was mainly due to lack of experience with Xcode as I eventually figured it out.
